OVERVIEW
========

This is a very small DCPU16 C SDK. It contains the bare minimum
to develop a C project on a linux based machine. It contains a 
C compiler (clang), an assembler (gas) and a linker (ld).

The src fold contains the source files of your project.
The include folder contains the include files.
The bin folder includes the executables you need.

Since this is a makefile based project, you need to modify the
Makefile to include all your src files.

USAGE
=====

The command "make" will generate a a.out file, which contains the
assembled and linked binary for a DCPU16.

With the command "make clean" you can clean up your project.
